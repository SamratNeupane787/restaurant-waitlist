		<h1> What is Restaurant Waitlist ?</h1>
		<p>The waitlist program is designed to manage a restaurant's waitlist. Here's how it works:

			When a customer arrives, their name is entered into the waitlist.
			As new customers are added to the waitlist, the existing customers are moved down in the list.
			When a table becomes available, the next customer on the waitlist is notified.
			If a customer leaves or cancels their reservation, they are removed from the waitlist.
			The program can estimate wait times for customers based on the number of parties ahead of them and average wait times.</p>
